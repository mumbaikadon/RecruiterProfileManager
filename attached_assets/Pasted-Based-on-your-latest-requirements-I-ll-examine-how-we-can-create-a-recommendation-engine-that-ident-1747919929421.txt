Based on your latest requirements, I'll examine how we can create a recommendation engine that identifies suitable candidates when new jobs are created, without changing the existing code.

Candidate Recommendation Engine for New Jobs
This system would automatically scan the existing candidate database when a new job is created to identify and recommend the best candidates based on:

Similar Job Titles
Location Matches (city, state, or time zone)
Previous Client Experience
Skill/Technology Matches
How This Would Work
When a new job is created, the system would trigger this process:

Initial Job Analysis:

Extract key information: job title, required skills, location, client name
Determine if the role is remote, hybrid, or on-site
Candidate Database Scan:

Query the existing candidates table and resume data
Apply matching algorithms to identify candidates with:
Similar job titles in their work history
Location compatibility (exact city match, same state, or same time zone)
Previous experience with the same client
Required skills/technologies
Recommendation Generation:

Rank candidates based on multiple match factors
Generate a "Top Candidates" list for the new job
Display these recommendations to recruiters
Implementation Approach
1. Job Creation Hook
We would create a new API endpoint that's called after a job is created:

/api/jobs/:id/recommended-candidates
This endpoint would run the matching algorithm and return suitable candidates
2. Matching Algorithm
The algorithm would calculate a composite score for each candidate:

candidateScore = 
  (titleMatchWeight × titleMatchScore) +
  (locationMatchWeight × locationMatchScore) +
  (clientMatchWeight × clientMatchScore) +
  (skillsMatchWeight × skillsMatchScore)
Where:

Title Match: Similarity between candidate's previous job titles and the new job title
Location Match: Geographic compatibility based on the job's location requirements
Client Match: Whether the candidate has worked for this client before
Skills Match: Overlap between candidate's skills and job requirements
3. User Interface Integration
In the job details page, add a new "Recommended Candidates" section that:

Shows the highest-scoring candidates from our database
Displays their match score and why they're recommended
Provides a quick "Submit Candidate" action

Technical Architecture
This recommendation engine would leverage the existing database structure:

Data Sources:

candidates table: Basic candidate information including location
resumeData table: Employment history, skills, client names
jobs table: Job requirements, location, client
Processing Flow:

Job is created/updated → Trigger recommendation calculation
System queries candidate and resume data
Apply matching algorithms against new job specifications
Store recommendations for quick retrieval
Display top matches to recruiters
Performance Considerations:

Run matches in background to avoid slowing down job creation
Cache recommendations but refresh when candidates are added/modified
Paginate results for jobs with many potential matches
This recommendation engine would make your recruitment process more proactive rather than reactive - instead of waiting for recruiters to manually search through candidates, the system would intelligently suggest the best fits as soon as a new job is posted.
